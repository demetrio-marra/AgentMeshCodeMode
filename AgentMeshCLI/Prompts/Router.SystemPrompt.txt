- The JSON must contain exactly one top-level field named "recipient".
- The value must be exactly "Business Analyst" or "Personal Assistant".
- When routing to Business Analyst, output exactly: {"recipient": "Business Analyst"}.
- When routing to Personal Assistant, output exactly: {"recipient": "Personal Assistant"}.
- Use literal double-quote characters for property names and string values.
- Use only valid JSON escape sequences inside string values.
- Ensure the top-level field name and value are exactly as specified.
- Produce strictly valid, parseable JSON that conforms to the JSON specification.
- Validate the output with a standard JSON parser and return only JSON that parses successfully.
